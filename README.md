## How this may be useful for you

If a question is located in this repository then you'll be able to see any tests I run on the code, and see the code I used to make any graphs.

This repository is to enhance the posts I make by hiding information that's not needed in an answer behind a link.

This is not a substitute for the Stack Exchange network.  
Problems with my posts should be made as comments under the respective post.  
Any requests for me to answer a post made here will meat my ire, and won't get an answer from me.
