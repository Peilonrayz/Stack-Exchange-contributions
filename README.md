## How this may be useful for you

If a question is located in this repository then you'll be able to see any tests I run on the code, and see the code I used to make any graphs.

## Disclamer stuffs

This is mostly for my own record.
Most of the intellectual property is derived from different peoples questions.
The original code is located in either an `orig.*` file or `orig` directory.
Everything else in the directory has either been derived from it, or created afresh by me.
You can view the original question by going to the question with the ID supplied, for the site.
