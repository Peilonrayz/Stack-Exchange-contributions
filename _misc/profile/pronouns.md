# Pronouns

Pronoun: none / Peilonrayz  
[Omission](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/336380): encouraged  
None of: They, he, she, and definitely not it

I'd prefer to not have a pronoun. To achieve this just use my name - a noun. Since pronouns go in the place of nouns, it should feel fairly natural. If this idea is foreign to you then, then think of my pronoun as Peilonrayz.

Peilonrayz as a pronoun has three forms:

Reflexive: &nbsp; &nbsp; Peilonrayzelf  
Possessive:    Peilonrayz'  
Other: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peilonrayz

Examples:

> ❌ They did  
> 💚 Peilonrayz did
> 
> ❌ It's them  
> 💚 It's Peilonrayz
> 
> ❌ their answer  
> 💚 Peilonrayz' answer
> 
> ❌ It's theirs  
> 💚 It's Peilonrayz'
> 
> ❌ Peilonrayz did it themself  
> 💚 Peilonrayz did it  
> 🧡 Peilonrayz did it Peilonrayzelf  

Overall thinking of my pronoun as Peilonrayz works fairly well. The only time that it's almost always unnatural is when using the reflexive form. I think this shows fairly well what the difference between the pronoun none and Peilonrayz is, and why none is prefered.

## Omission

I would prefer to read natural sentences, and I'm sure you would like to write natural ones too. And so even if it's not your normal writing style __please omit my pronouns__, [contrary to SE's rules](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/336380).

> ❌ The OP wrote in their question
>   
> 💚 The OP wrote in the question  
> 💚 Peilonrayz wrote in the question  
> 🧡 Peilonrayz wrote in Peilonrayz' question  
> ❌ The OP wrote in Peilonrayz' question

The second to last seems fairly unnatural, and so I would discourage it.  
The last is fairly confusing, as it's talking about me as if I'm two different entities. Please don't do this.

## Unnatural

Given that most interactions are in second person, the use of third person pronouns should be fairly uncommon. However there are some instances that this can still feel unnatural, even with omission.

### If you're only talking about me.

Most of the time on Stack Exchange you should be talking about the content, not the user. I don't see this as a problem. Rather it helps keep you focused on the things that matter.

> ❌ I saw them yesterday. They are doing well.  
> 🧡 I saw Peilonrayz yesterday. Peilonrayz is doing well.  
> 🧡 I saw Peilonrayz, doing well, yesterday.

### Feels like trolling.

It was [brought to my attention by SE](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/338188) that wishing to have no pronoun is thought of as trolling. I understand lots of people have strong ideas around pronouns, and so please hold onto your beliefs of me, whether you think I'm a troll or not.  
But let's be nice to each other. If you want to bring to my attention you don't believe the pronouns for the Peilonrayz identity then feel free to say something. Here's a guide on ways to say, or not say, it.

> 💚 It's hard for me to not use pronouns.  
> 💚 I don't think you are the pronouns you say you are.  
> 🧡 I think you're being disingenuous with your pronouns.  
> 🧡 I think you're lying about your pronouns.    
> 🧡 Not using pronouns is hard.  
> ❌ You're lying about your pronouns.  
> ❌ You're just trolling with your pronouns.  
> 💀 You're a filthy troll.  

This should be a fairly small issue, so it should be easy to resolve.
