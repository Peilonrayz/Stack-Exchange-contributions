Licencing
=========

Non StackExchange files
=======================

- The files in :code:`./_configs` and :code:`._helpers`,
- the top level files, except :code:`LICENSE`,
- The files named :code:`./*/readme.rst` or :code:`./*/readme.md` where `*` is a Stack Exchange network folder

Are dual-licenced under MIT and CC BY-SA 3.0.

StackExchange posts
===================

The licencing in 'Stack Exchange folders' are fairly complicated.

In general, all derived code is CC BY-SA 3.0, and any new code, that's my IP, is dual-licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 and MIT.
This means if you don't know what license something is then you can just default to CC BY-SA 3.0.

Unless otherwise stated the following files and folders are under the following licences.

CC BY-SA 3.0
    - src

.. warning::

    Code in post.md or old_post.md may be under only CC BY-SA 3.0 or be dual-licenced.

    You will have to check what the code's source files are licenced under.

MIT & CC BY-SA 3.0
    - post.rst
    - post.md
    - old_post.md
    - readme.rst
    - static
    - tests

Attributions
------------

The attribution for derived code, CC BY-SA 3.0, can be found in the :code:`readme.rst` of the relevant folder.
Or in the file before the code that is being derived.
